# The Abel-Jacobi map in SageMath

## The implementation of the Abel-Jacobi map provided here has since been merged into Sage, and so there is no longer a requirement to use this repository unless you are using an older version of Sage.

SageMath gives the user to perform calculations with [Riemann surfaces](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/curves/sage/schemes/riemann_surfaces/riemann_surface.html), and as part of a [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) project titled ["Rigorous integration and the Abel-Jacobi map"](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#5395494311821312) I worked with [Nils Bruin](http://www.cecm.sfu.ca/~nbruin/index.shtml), one of the functionalities initial authors, to add the ability to calculate the Abel-Jacobi map. This work was done over the course of Sage trac tickets [#30698](https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/30698), [#31996](https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/31996), [#32014](https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/32014), [#32018](https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/32018), [#32059](https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/32059), [#32289](https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/32289), and [#32297](https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/32297). These tickets were concerned with 
* numerical integration techniques (tickets #30698, #32014, #32018, #32289), and 
* implementing these numerical techniques within the Riemann surfaces package (tickets #31996, #32059, #32297).

For each ticket, to see the contributions of the author look at the commits in the change history. At the time of writing, edits from #30698, #32014, #32018, and #32059 have been merged into the develop branch for Sage 9.4, and so the code from these edits is accesible there (follow [these](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/walk_through.html) instructions). The edits from ticket #32289 are no longer required, and so they have been left. The edits in tickets #31996 and #32297 were concerned with the Sage source file ``riemann_surface.py``, and so to allow the use and developement of this code before it is merged, I am presenting it here. To use the version of the code here, once downloaded, run ``load("PATH_TO_FILE/riemann_surface.py")`` in your shell.
